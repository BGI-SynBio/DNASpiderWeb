Here we sort out the simplified supporting data from 
[the raw data](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/experiments/raw)
through
[sort_data.py](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/experiments/sort_data.py).

The simplified supporting data support all figures and tables in the main text and the supplementary.
