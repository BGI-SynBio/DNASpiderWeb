DNA has become an attractive medium for storing digital information gradually. 
Despite the biochemical progress on DNA synthesis and sequencing, 
novel coding algorithms need to be constructed under the specific constraints in DNA-based storage. 
In recent years, a growing number of functional operations and storage carriers were introduced, 
bringing in various biochemical constraints including but not confined to long single-nucleotide repeats and abnormal GC content. 
Given several local biochemical constraints and their combinations, 
existing coding algorithms are not applicable or unstable. 
In this paper, we design a graph-based architecture, named **SPIDER-WEB**, 
to generate corresponding graph-based algorithms under arbitrary local biochemical constraints.
These generated coding algorithms could be used to encode arbitrary digital data as DNA sequences directly 
or served as a benchmark for the follow-up construction of coding algorithms. 
To further consider recovery and security issues existing in the storage field, 
it also provides pluggable algorithmic patches based on the generated coding algorithms: 
path-based correcting and mapping shuffling.
They provide approaches for probabilistic error correction and symmetric encryption respectively.

## Installation
You can install this package using pip:
```sh
pip install DNASpiderWeb
```

## Usage and Customization
### biochemical constraints set
You can create your customized biochemical constraint filter (as the biochemical constraints set) 
by inheriting [DefaultBioFilter](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/dsw/biofilter.py#L4).
For example:

```python
from dsw import DefaultBioFilter

class RegionalizedGCFilter(DefaultBioFilter):

    def __init__(self, window_length, gc_bias):
        super().__init__(screen_name="Regionalized GC content constraint")
        self._window_length = window_length
        self._gc_bias = gc_bias  # bias based on 0.5 (or 50%)
    
    def valid(self, dna_string):
        if len(dna_string) >= self._window_length:
            for index in range(len(dna_string) - self._window_length + 1):  # judge in a window
                regional_dna_string = dna_string[index: index + self._window_length]
                gc_count = regional_dna_string.count("C") + regional_dna_string.count("G")
                if gc_count > (0.5 + self._gc_bias) * self._window_length:
                    return False
                if gc_count < (0.5 - self._gc_bias) * self._window_length:
                    return False
                    
        else:
            gc_count = dna_string.count("C") + dna_string.count("G")
            if gc_count > (0.5 + self._gc_bias) * self._window_length:
                return False
            at_count = dna_string.count("A") + dna_string.count("T")
            if at_count > (0.5 + self._gc_bias) * self._window_length:
                return False
                
        return True
```

Here is an investigated example in this work named 
[LocalBioFilter](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/dsw/biofilter.py#L30).

### capacity approximation
Through our customized approximater, 
see [here](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/dsw/graphized.py#L534), 
you can easily obtain the capacity under the specific biochemical constraint set.
```python
from dsw import LocalBioFilter, find_vertices, connect_valid_graph, approximate_capacity

bio_filter = LocalBioFilter(max_homopolymer_runs=2, gc_range=[0.4, 0.6], undesired_motifs=["GCC"])
vertices = find_vertices(observed_length=10, bio_filter=bio_filter)
accessor = connect_valid_graph(observed_length=10, vertices=vertices)  # representation of directed graph
capacity = approximate_capacity(accessor=accessor)
print(capacity)
```

The capacity approximater is based on the Perronâ€“Frobenius theorem,
we have proved its applicability for coding algorithms 
in the Appendix A of our [publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.02855.pdf).

Unfortunately, when the observed length (or window length) reaches 8, 
the data capacity will achieve 16.0GB with the data type (integer format), 
which is unable to be allocated (both MATLAB and Python platforms).
Therefore, see [here](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/dsw/graphized.py),
we provide a series of special data structures and approximation algorithms 
to complete the representation of graphs and the solution of largest eigenvalues.
 
To verify its [reliability](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/experiments/step_2_reliability.py), 
we compared our proposed method with Numpy ``linalg.eig'' function in some small-scale matrices.
As part of the experimental results, the median value of relative error analysis is 2.97E-11, 
which represents the relative error of capacity approximation is on the order of minus ten of ten.
Because it is equivalent to error tolerance in the preset values, 
we believe our proposed method is high reliability and negligible error. 

### graph-based encoding
<p align="center">
<img src="./docs/source/_static/strategy_1.png" alt="graph-based encoding" title="graph-based encoding" width="100%"/>
</p>

According to **SPIDER-WEB**, you can generate a coding algorithm under the established biochemical constraints.
For example,
```python
from dsw import LocalBioFilter, find_vertices, connect_coding_graph
bio_filter = LocalBioFilter(max_homopolymer_runs=2, gc_range=[0.4, 0.6], undesired_motifs=["ACA", "CAC", "GTG", "TGT"])
vertices = find_vertices(observed_length=10, bio_filter=bio_filter)
accessor = connect_coding_graph(observed_length=10, vertices=vertices, threshold=1)  # representation of directed graph
```
In [experiments folder](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/experiments/__init__.py), 
you can easily find 12 examples in our experiments under the observed length 10, the local biochemical constraint set are:

| set index | homopolymer run-length | regionalized GC content | undesired motifs | approximated capacity |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----|
| 01 |  2  | 50%~50% | restriction sites | 1.0000 |
| 02 |  1  |   N/A   | N/A | 1.5850 |
| 03 | N/A | 10%~30% | N/A | 1.6302 |
| 04 |  2  | 40%~60% | similar structures | 1.6698 |
| 05 |  2  | 40%~60% | N/A | 1.7761 |
| 06 | N/A | 50%~70% | N/A | 1.7958 |
| 07 |  3  | 40%~60% | N/A | 1.8114 |
| 08 |  4  | 40%~60% | N/A | 1.8152 |
| 09 |  3  |   N/A   | N/A | 1.9824 |
| 10 |  4  |   N/A   | N/A | 1.9957 |
| 11 |  5  |   N/A   | N/A | 1.9989 |
| 12 |  6  |   N/A   | N/A | 1.9997 |

Here the restriction sites represent AGCT, GACGC, CAGCAG, GATATC, GGTACC, CTGCAG, GAGCTC, GTCGAC, AGTACT, ACTAGT, GCATGC, AGGCCT, and TCTAGA.
Meanwhile, the similar structures in Nanopore sequencing are AGA, GAG, CTC, and TCT.

The corresponding coding performances of generated coding algorithms are shown 
in the evaluation section of our [publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.02855.pdf).

As an example, the encoding process for a GC-balanced accessor is:
```python
from numpy import array
from dsw import encode
accessor = array([[-1, -1, -1, -1], [ 4, -1, -1,  7], [ 8, -1, -1, 11], [-1, -1, -1, -1], 
                  [-1,  1,  2, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, 13, 14, -1], 
                  [-1,  1,  2, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, 13, 14, -1], 
                  [-1, -1, -1, -1], [ 4, -1, -1,  7], [ 8, -1, -1, 11], [-1, -1, -1, -1]])
binary_message = array([0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1])
encode(accessor=accessor, binary_message=binary_message, start_index=1)
```
and a DNA string 
````
'TCTCTCT'
```` 
will be obtained.

Reversely, in the decoding process:
```python
from numpy import array
from dsw import decode
accessor = array([[-1, -1, -1, -1], [ 4, -1, -1,  7], [ 8, -1, -1, 11], [-1, -1, -1, -1], 
                  [-1,  1,  2, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, 13, 14, -1], 
                  [-1,  1,  2, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, 13, 14, -1], 
                  [-1, -1, -1, -1], [ 4, -1, -1,  7], [ 8, -1, -1, 11], [-1, -1, -1, -1]])
dna_string = "TCTCTCT"
decode(accessor=accessor, dna_string=dna_string, start_index=1, bit_length=8)
```
and you will obtain a binary message with NumPy format: 
````
array([0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1])
````      
        
### path-based correcting
<p align="center">
<img src="./docs/source/_static/strategy_2.png" alt="path-based correcting" title="path-based correcting" width="100%"/>
</p>

Before biochemical operation, 
it may be considered to provide better error correction performance using an additional 'salt-protected' DNA string.
Here, we provide the such short DNA string an the value check based on Varshamov-Tenengolts code.
You can use the code as follow:
```python
from dsw import set_vt
vt_length = 5
dna_string = "TCTCTCT"
set_vt(dna_string=dna_string, vt_length=vt_length)
```
After that, you'll get a check string:
````
'TAATA'
```` 

Without the check string, you can repair the DNA string directly through our proposed 'saturated reverse search'.
Here is a case:
```python
from numpy import array
from dsw import repair_dna
accessor = array([[-1, -1, -1, -1], [ 4, -1, -1,  7], [ 8, -1, -1, 11], [-1, -1, -1, -1], 
                  [-1,  1,  2, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, 13, 14, -1], 
                  [-1,  1,  2, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, 13, 14, -1], 
                  [-1, -1, -1, -1], [ 4, -1, -1,  7], [ 8, -1, -1, 11], [-1, -1, -1, -1]])
dna_string = "TCTCTATCTCTC"  # "TCTCTCTCTCTC" is original DNA string
repair_dna(dna_string=dna_string, accessor=accessor, start_index=1, observed_length=2, 
           check_iterations=1, has_insertion=True, has_deletion=True, verbose=False)
```
The returned data is a tuple: 
````
(['TCTCTCTCTCTC', 'TCTCTGTCTCTC'], (True, False, 2))
````
The former one is the repair string set, which may contain one or more candidate solutions.
The latter one is the temporary parameters in the repair process are used to evaluate the repair results.

After using check string, the result of path-based correcting improved significantly:
```python
from numpy import array
from dsw import repair_dna
accessor = array([[-1, -1, -1, -1], [ 4, -1, -1,  7], [ 8, -1, -1, 11], [-1, -1, -1, -1], 
                  [-1,  1,  2, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, 13, 14, -1], 
                  [-1,  1,  2, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, 13, 14, -1], 
                  [-1, -1, -1, -1], [ 4, -1, -1,  7], [ 8, -1, -1, 11], [-1, -1, -1, -1]])
dna_string = "TCTCTATCTCTC"  # "TCTCTCTCTCTC" is original DNA string
vt_check = "AACTG"  # check list of Varshamov-Tenengolts code.
repair_dna(dna_string=dna_string, accessor=accessor, start_index=1, observed_length=2, 
           check_iterations=1, vt_check=vt_check, has_insertion=True, has_deletion=True, verbose=False)
```
The updated result is: 
````
(['TCTCTCTCTCTC'], (True, True, 2))
````

### mapping shuffling
<p align="center">
<img src="./docs/source/_static/strategy_3.png" alt="mapping shuffling" title="mapping shuffling" width="100%"/>
</p>

To provide a certain amount of additional security against eavesdroppers, 
it would be nice to create a shuffled matrix to disorganize
the label order of different vertices in the digraph for the encoding process.
You can design a matrix with shape of 4^l times 4 (l refers to the observed length).
Each row of this matrix is the order of 0 ~ 3.
As an alternative, you can create a random matrix (supporting random seed setup), see below:
```python
from dsw import create_random_shuffles
create_random_shuffles(observed_length=2, random_seed=2021)
```
By doing so,
````
array([[3, 2, 1, 0], [2, 3, 1, 0], [3, 1, 0, 2], [0, 3, 1, 2],
       [3, 2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 3, 2], [0, 3, 1, 2], [2, 0, 1, 3],
       [2, 3, 0, 1], [1, 0, 3, 2], [2, 0, 1, 3], [0, 1, 3, 2],
       [2, 3, 1, 0], [2, 0, 3, 1], [0, 1, 3, 2], [0, 3, 2, 1]])
````
is the returned shuffled matrix.

Using your shuffled matrix, the obtained DNA string will be different than before: 
```python
from numpy import array
from dsw import encode
accessor = array([[-1, -1, -1, -1], [ 4, -1, -1,  7], [ 8, -1, -1, 11], [-1, -1, -1, -1], 
                  [-1,  1,  2, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, 13, 14, -1], 
                  [-1,  1,  2, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, 13, 14, -1], 
                  [-1, -1, -1, -1], [ 4, -1, -1,  7], [ 8, -1, -1, 11], [-1, -1, -1, -1]])
binary_message = array([0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1])
shuffles = array([[3, 2, 1, 0], [2, 3, 1, 0], [3, 1, 0, 2], [0, 3, 1, 2], 
                  [3, 2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 3, 2], [0, 3, 1, 2], [2, 0, 1, 3], 
                  [2, 3, 0, 1], [1, 0, 3, 2], [2, 0, 1, 3], [0, 1, 3, 2], 
                  [2, 3, 1, 0], [2, 0, 3, 1], [0, 1, 3, 2], [0, 3, 2, 1]])
encode(accessor=accessor, binary_message=binary_message, shuffles=shuffles, start_index=1)
```
you can get 
````
'AGAGAGA'
```` 
rather than 'TCTCTCT' before.

If you use mapping shuffling, please don't forget to pass in the corresponding parameter during the decoding process.
