As a genetic material, DNA has become an attractive medium for storing digital information gradually.
In recent years, a growing number of functional biochemical operations and storage environments were introduced, 
biochemical constraints are not confined to long single-nucleotide repeats and abnormal GC content.
However, trade-offs between information density and compatibility to biochemical operations and algorithms require in-depth investigation, 
to create transcoding algorithms considering novel biochemical constraints and their combinations.
Here, we design an automatic generator, named **SPIDER-WEB**, 
to create corresponding graph-based algorithms 
which could be used directly or served as a benchmark for artificial algorithm design.
The coding algorithms generated by **SPIDER-WEB** provide 
[high code rate](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/experiments/step_1_compatibility.py),
[low parameter sensitivity](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/experiments/step_3_stability.py),
[certain self-repair ability](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/experiments/step_4_repairability.py), and
[valuable privacy protection potentiality](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/experiments/step_5_privacy.py).
Through this work, applicable algorithms with appropriate density-compatibility trade-off under arbitrary local biochemical constraints could be generated in an automated way. 
It is also suggested that more kinds of biochemical constraints can be further investigated as more complex operations would be needed in future DNA storage systems.


## Basic evaluations

Some basic evaluation results of 
[**SPIDER-WEB**](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/dsw/spiderweb.py) are recorded 
[here](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/tree/main/experiments/results/figures/).
These figures are generated directly through the process Python scripts 
[here](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/tree/main/experiments/).

Compared with 
[HEDGES](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/31/18489.full), 
[DNA Fountain](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aaj2038) and 
[Yin-Yang Code](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/829721v3), 
the rough (not academic) conclusions are as follows:

where 
* [C-R] refers to the code rate, the statistical result of which is the average number of binary bits encoded per nucleotide; 
* [C-A] refers to the codability, the statistical result of which is the success rate of encoding process;
* [P-S] refers to the parameter sensibility, the statistical result of which is the normalized standard deviation of code rate;
* [R-A] refers to the repairability, the statistical result of which is the normalized average DNA length of lossless decoding.


## Usage and Customization
### local biochemical constraints set
You can create your customized local biochemical constraint filter by inheriting [DefaultBioFilter](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/dsw/biofilter.py#L4), such as
Here is a simple example in this work named [LocalBioFilter](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/dsw/biofilter.py#L30).

### Directed graph generated from valid DNA string
You can generate your directed graph based on the above-mentioned customized filter or local biochemical constraint group:
```python
from dsw import LocalBioFilter, find_vertices, connect_valid_graph

# bio_filter = CustomizedBioFilter(requirements=your requirements)
bio_filter = LocalBioFilter(observed_length=10, max_homopolymer_runs=2, gc_range=[0.4, 0.6], undesired_motifs=["ACA", "CAC", "GTG", "TGT"])
vertices = find_vertices(length=10, bio_filter=bio_filter, save_path="local")
graph = connect_valid_graph(length=10, vertices=vertices, save_path="local")
```
Through our customized approximater, 
see [here](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/dsw/graphized.py#L537), 
you can easily obtain the capacity under the specific biochemical constraint set.
```python
from dsw import LocalBioFilter, find_vertices, connect_valid_graph, approximate_capacity

bio_filter = LocalBioFilter(max_homopolymer_runs=2, gc_range=[0.4, 0.6], undesired_motifs=["ACA", "CAC", "GTG", "TGT"])
vertices = find_vertices(length=10, bio_filter=bio_filter, save_path="local")
graph = connect_valid_graph(length=10, vertices=vertices, save_path="local")
capacity = approximate_capacity(graph=graph)
print(capacity)
```

The capacity approximater is based on the Perronâ€“Frobenius theorem, that is, $\log_2(\lambda)$
We have proved its applicability for variable-length coding algorithms in the publication.

Unfortunately, when the observed length (or window length) reaches $8$, 
the data capacity will achieve $(4^{8 \times 8}) \times (8 \times 8) = 32.0$GB 
with the data type (double-precision floating-point format), 
which is unable to be allocated (both MATLAB and Python platforms).
Therefore, see [here](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/dsw/graphized.py),
we provide a series of special data structures and approximation algorithms 
to complete the representation of graphs and the solution of maximum eigenvalues.
 
To verify its [reliability](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/experiments/step_2_reliability.py), 
we compared our proposed method with Numpy ``linalg.eig'' function in some small-scale matrices.
As part of the experimental results, the median value of relative error analysis is $2.97 \times 10^{-11}$, 
which represents our proposed method is high reliability and negligible error.

### Automatic algorithm generator named SPIDER-WEB
According to **SPIDER-WEB**, you can obtain the corresponding variable-length algorithms:

```python
from dsw import LocalBioFilter, find_vertices, connect_coding_graph

bio_filter = LocalBioFilter(max_homopolymer_runs=2, gc_range=[0.4, 0.6], undesired_motifs=["ACA", "CAC", "GTG", "TGT"])
vertices = find_vertices(length=10, bio_filter=bio_filter, save_path="local")
graph = connect_coding_graph(length=10, vertices=vertices, threshold=1, save_path="../results/data/")
```
In [experiments folder](https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/DNASpiderWeb/blob/main/experiments/__init__.py), 
you can easily find 12 examples in our experiments.
