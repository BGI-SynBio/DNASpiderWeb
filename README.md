# DNA Spider-Web
As a genetic material, DNA has become an attractive medium for storing digital information gradually.
Artificially-designed coding schemes may not be reliable under certain binary patterns or biochemical constraints.
Here, we report an automatic generator based on Graph theory, named DNA Spider-Web,
to establish end-to-end coding schemes with implicit rules under the trade-off between information density
and local feasibility (biochemical constraints: homoploymer runs, GC content, and special motifs).
